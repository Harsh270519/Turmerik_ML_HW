‘Ozempic babies’: Reports of surprise pregnancies raise new questions about weight loss drugs,,https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/08/health/ozempic-babies-pregnancy/index.html,1cnf2q3,1715201554,89,754,"PCOS is a common cause of fertility troubles and it’s not uncommon for women with PCOS to also have insulin resistance, which makes it harder to lose weight, which makes their PCOS symptoms worse, creating a really challenging cycle. It doesn’t seem that odd that a drug that helps with insulin levels in turn helps manage PCOS related hormonal imbalances and in turn increases fertility.

The title is awfully click baity, as there’s not really any surprise or “question” here besides whether it’s safe for these women who got pregnant to continue ozempic during their pregnancy ||| Ozempic and Mounjaro are part of a class of drugs called GLP-1 receptor agonists, which act by mimicking hormones in the gut involved in insulin regulation and appetite. They’re both approved to treat type 2 diabetes, and each have twin medicines approved for weight loss. Ozempic uses the active ingredient semaglutide, and Wegovy is the version approved for weight loss. Mounjaro uses tirzepatide, which also targets a second hormone called GIP, and Zepbound is its brand name for weight loss.

The medicines have been shown to help people lose 15% to 20% of their body weight, on average, in clinical trials. And because of the way GLP-1 drugs work, experts say, there are reasons they may lead to more pregnancies as well as cause for caution about their use in early pregnancy.

Numerous women have shared stories of [“Ozempic babies”](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/08/health/ozempic-babies-pregnancy/index.html) on social media. But the joy some experience in discovering pregnancies may come with anxiety about the unknowns, as these medicines haven’t been studied in people who are pregnant.

“We don’t know the effect of early exposure … on the fetus,” said Dr. Jody Dushay, a physician focused on endocrinology and metabolism at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.

Dushay said she recommends that women stop taking these drugs two months before trying to get pregnant, as directed in their prescribing information. ||| Periods behaving oddly while losing weight is not completely new info. While losing weight, I highly recommend everyone who can get pregnant take extra precautions to not. ||| Additionally, delayed emptying of the stomach doesn't allow for the timelines that the pill demands to be as effective as it could. ||| I'm a T2D that has been on Ozempic for 18 months. I have lost 22% of my starting body weight. I feel better than I have in twenty years, I have less inflammation in general. My PCP is board certified in internal medicine and her opinion is that the real long-term benefit of these drugs isn't just lower blood glucose, it's the general reduction in inflammation. ||| 2024 Most Popular baby name:  Ozy ||| Plenty of women who have fertility troubles are told to lose weight in order to conceive. I was usually around 160 to 170 lbs, and my period was irregular. I dropped 20 pounds, my period came back on time every month, and the fourth month back, I got pregnant. After I stopped breastfeeding, my period returned monthly. At that time, I was 150 pounds. Now I'm 165, and it's irregular again. ||| Is Rick Ross pregnant? ||| 2024 will now be forever known as the year Novo Nordisk’s evil plan to inseminate the world with its chud seed via weight loss drugs came to fruition.

I'm ready! ||| Eli Lilly chief information and digital officer Diogo Rau was recently involved in some experiments in the office, but not the typical drug research work that you might expect to be among the lab tinkering inside a major pharmaceutical company.

Lilly has been using generative AI to search through millions of molecules. With AI able to move at a speed of discovery which in five minutes can generate as many molecules as Lilly could synthesize in an entire year in traditional wet labs, it make sense to test the limits of artificial intelligence in medicine. But there’s no way to know if the abundance of AI-generated designs will work in the real world, and that’s something skeptical company executives wanted to learn more about.

The top AI-generated biological designs, molecules that Rau described as having “weird-looking structures” that could not be matched to much in the company’s existing molecular database, but that looked like potentially strong drug candidates, were taken to Lilly research scientists. Executives, including Rau, expected scientists to dismiss the AI results.

 “They can’t possibly be this good?” he remembered thinking before presented the AI results.

**IBM SAYS** ...

>The artificial neurons in a deep learning model are inspired by neurons in the brain, but they’re nowhere near as efficient. Training just one of today’s generative models can cost millions of dollars in computer processing time. But as expensive as training an AI model can be, it’s dwarfed by the expense of inferencing. Each time someone runs an AI model on their computer, or on a mobile phone at the edge, there’s a cost — in kilowatt hours, dollars, and carbon emissions.

>Because up to 90% of an AI-model’s life is spent in inference mode, the bulk of AI’s carbon footprint is also here, in serving AI models to the world.

**MIT SAYS**:

>What all of these approaches have in common is that they convert inputs into a set of tokens, which are numerical representations of chunks of data. As long as your data can be converted into this standard, token format, then in theory, you could apply these methods to generate new data that look similar.

"The Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday said it is challenging hundreds of alleged “junk” patents held by pharmaceutical companies for 20 brand-name drugs, including Novo Nordisk’s blockbuster drugs Ozempic, Saxenda and Victoza",,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/30/ftc-challenges-patents-held-by-drugmakers-including-for-ozempic.html,1ch03ao,1714502020,11,66,"Journalism truly is dead. I read several different articles and they all basically have the same content. No one explaining what a junk patent actually is, why this applies to any specific drug, or what this FTC action will actually accomplish. ||| A junk patent is a patent filed, by the original patent holder, (that the patent holder knows will not be granted) in the hopes of extending the exclusivity period of the original patent and to prevent other entrants to the marketplace. 

It is relevant for these particular drugs since they are extremely high volume drugs where their initial patents should have expired and for whom there should be readily available generic alternatives. 

By allowing other generic entrants into the marketplace the government is hoping to force a reduction in the price of these drugs thereby making them readily available for a much larger percentage of the population.

ETA: For the purposes of the article, they are also including ancillary patents that are sometimes filed by the patent holder before the expiration of the original patent to prolong the exclusivity period of the original product. ||| I agree. I listened to a story about a ""cheap"" drug that has been showing evidence of extending people's lives, so now an official study is being proposed. They mentioned the drug, possible side effects and they did a passing statement about ""ask your Doctor if they will put you on it."" But, not once did they mention the price for this ""cheap"" drug. ||| These outlets are publishing a press release stating facts from a government agency, you are only allowed very minor changes to official government agency PR releases before publishing. This has been a part of journalism since the dawn of the printing press. Just a boring part. Think of this as a repost with strict rules, FTC is the one putting out a release for publication with minimal background. Actual coverage and opinion pieces will come later. ||| Thank you for the explanation. I hope it works (you never know with the courts, bribes, and regulatory capture tricks). Semaglutide in particular should be more available and way less expensive. 

Is the idea that the extra patents are just kind of in limbo and still processing and preventing generics until they’re denied? ||| Prices depend on so many factors, there is rarely one stated MSRP for a drug product in the USA, and to state one incorrectly could lead to legal issues from all sides.

What you're describing is an issue with drug pricing and pricing transparency, making it impossible for anyone -- even news agencies -- to clearly define one price. ||| They very often do not follow up though. I’ll see something like this, make a note of it, search for it weeks later, and there’s just even more posts of the same press release ||| I’m far from an expert but my understanding is that due to a loophole in US law, the original patent essentially remains “valid” until there is a definitive decision made about the validity of all patent applications associated with a particular product and under US law there is an option for unlimited appeals regarding a decision by the patent office which also allows for the original patent to essentially remain “valid” until all appeals are exhausted.

Generic manufacturers usually have developed their drugs and have them ready to go to market before the patent is expired but if they know that the original patent may be extended or that a new patent will be granted then they will not risk bringing their generic to market for fear of litigation from the original patent holder.

ETA: added quotes to “valid” because in reality the original patent does expire but the application of new patents essentially has the effect of extending the expiration of the original patents. ||| Telling me an average price with a disclaimer statement like ""check your insurance and local outlets for more accurate price"" would have been find. It just felt like lazy journalism to announce a ""cheap"" drug but without any pricing context. ""Cheap"" is a relative term that means something different to most people. ||| So it’s just a loophole that allows them to troll the system. I hope the FTC is ready to fight them on this"

What do weight loss drugs mean for a diet industry built on eating less and exercising more?,,https://apnews.com/article/weight-loss-drugs-wegovy-diet-industry-weightwatchers-9df7a519d48e85f020151e291e982bea,1ccou5v,1714042036,12,56,"A more holistic approach? I think the drugs could complement and improve results from eating less and exercising more. ||| Wish I could make the font bigger but it means:  
REKT ||| No one struggled with weight 70 years ago. Back then everyone knew bread makes you fat. Eat your animal fat and protein. Limit your carbohydrates. It’s that simple. ||| Exactly.  They aren’t miracle drugs - you still have to put in work. ||| They also had cocaine in their sodas. ||| They literally work by making it easier to eat less, which is half of the “eating less and exercising more” formula.

Edit: I think the headline is confusing and the article itself is a bit muddled, but it seems to be exploring the hypothesis that weight loss medications are contributing to a transformation in how people view weight loss, toward a more health-centered model rather than vanity-centered. They give the example of SlimFast changing its marketing from “drink this to lose weight” to “drink this so you can be sure to get everything your body needs as you consume fewer calories.”

It still comes down to consuming fewer calories than you lose — aka eating less and/or exercising more — but I can appreciate the different nuance. If they’re right that people will increasingly treat dieting as a health-driven decision to be pursued in a healthy way, then great. ||| No they didn't. ||| And calorie for calorie food was more expensive, less easily quickly available --- not to say that their diet was healthier, it wasn't food was still unhealthy."

Most of us are pushed to our limits so the executives can hit their financial metrics to receive bonuses. The other half of the burnout equation is dealing with insurance.

I’m in recovery from alcohol abuse. No single human can choose to “play god” as that’s unethical. However, being from an addiction background, we make our choices. I’m not saying to withhold treatments from anyone— that’s gawdawful. However, if people can make choices to destroy their bodies because *ScIeNcE* will fix it, I also think that’s wrong. 😑 What becomes the motivation to live healthier because “*SoCiEtY* will fix me” regardless? (Also that means increased taxes for all the “free” care). I’ve lived in “free healthcare” countries and it’s not “free” when 40% of your paycheck goes to covering healthcare expenses of the self inflicted treatment of others.

Edited: adding that NO ONE in layman’s society understands that *cancer* is not blanketed. Every single cell type, enzymatic pathway, and intracellular receptors comes into play when determining treatment. There will never be a resolve for “all cancers”.  So why hasn’t everyone figured out how to “fix it”,  it’s because it is so much more complex than that. ||| Remember health care is expensive and an unhealthy lifestyle is the single biggest cost that we healthy people pay for.

To make drug companies prove their product actually works and is safe for people. ||| I had a client that took this. That sucks. I say had because I have a new job.

The FDA is risking its credibility with these conditional approvals. Similar to Aduhelm or any drug from Sarepta Therapeutics, none of which demonstrated a benefit in clinical trials.

The alternative is to have a drug that looks promising during early clinical trails but can’t be approved until sometimes years of clinical trails are completed.

I can’t even begin to tell you the amount of patients that are alive solely because of them. Medical errors are the #3 cause of death worldwide. Shit fucking happens, there are risks to everything. This crosses your aortic valve and sits a couple centimeters  in the left ventricle. Risk of perforation is rare, but a possibility with the nature of where it is in the body. These patients also don’t have as thick tissue in their heart- they most likely have heart failure or suffered a heart attack that impacts the structural integrity of the heart. The provider and staff maintaining this device play a huge role in the safety, as does the patient with their level of compliance. I worked in CVICU and now Cath lab, and these work miracles. Everything has a risk. This saves lives.

What needed to change. ||| couldn’t have tested this BEFORE it was released? FDA has been a joke recently after increasing budget cuts. every other day there’s another recall. ||| Also, I would imagine that without these devices the patients would have died long before one might be improperly placed and kill them. ||| If you read the article:

> The Impella left sided pumps are used to temporarily support a patient's heart during high-risk procedures or after a severe heart attack.

> But the regulator warned it could puncture a wall in the heart's left ventricle if used incorrectly.

> The device's manufacturer, Abiomed, has issued new instructions for the pump.

> A summary posted on the FDA's website on 21 March classified the move as ""most serious type of recall"" because of the risk of serious injuries or death if the device is used incorrectly.

> The agency warned that the use of affected pumps may also cause serious adverse health consequences, including ""hypertension, lack of blood flow, and death"".

> But it added that the recall was a correction, not a product removal, and the device will remain on the market.

It’s because it’s not being used right, not that the product itself is dangerous. ||| Probably because most devises are not tested, they are given a 510k because they are considered substantially equivalent. ||| i know i did read the article. this should have been instated BEFORE it was released, now people are dead. ||| Not sure why people are downvoting you, because it’s kinda correct. I say kinda because they are tested, but not rigorously like a new a new device would.  This 501k lets them bypass a significant amount of clinical trials. Which sometimes makes sense because the improvements are small and if we needed clinical trials for every small change we would either not have those or it would make things extremely expensive.  ||| It probably was stated. In trials, the surgeons or whoever was using the device was probably much more familiar with the nuances of using it. The surgeons causing problems are probably not familiar enough with the device to use it safely, but are anyway and killing their patients.

I wanted to pass along a report we just published. Here's an excerpt:  


>In the final weeks of 2022, a small team of inspectors from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were far from home, investigating a pharmaceutical factory in western India.  
>  
>Indian drugmaker Intas was making cancer drugs for the United States at the plant where, in a trash bin, inspectors found documents doused in acetic acid. More papers with manufacturing and drug testing data were shredded and tucked away in plastic bags under a stairwell, indicating that Intas executives had manipulated data and tried to cover it up.  
>  
>Six months later, the FDA called the drugs adulterated and halted imports from the plant, contributing to a severe shortage of life-saving cancer drugs in the United States.  
>  
>U.S. physicians say the cancer drug shortage could lead to thousands of deaths. The crisis has compelled Washington to turn to China despite broader efforts at reducing its reliance on the nation. China’s Qilu Pharmaceutical has been called in to make up for the shortfall.   
>  
>India’s lax regulatory oversight, analog practices where things should be digitized, and data integrity issues have far-reaching consequences that include hundreds of children dying from contaminated cough syrups across the world, and the potential to reshape geopolitical dynamics in the global drug trade.  
>  
>“If Indian drugmakers really want to cater to overseas markets, it is very important they adhere to global standards, however stringent,” Brajesh Singh, an associate director at consultancy Arthur D. Little, told Nikkei.   
>  
>“It will be an opportunity lost if they don’t … because the ‘China plus one’ policy really makes it India’s moment to seize,” Singh said, referring to a strategy in which companies reduce their dependence on China by diversifying their supply chains to other countries.  
>  
>India’s Intas was a key supplier of chemotherapy drugs cisplatin and carboplatin for the U.S. market. The version of cisplatin made by China’s Qilu, not yet approved by the FDA, is now available by prescription for U.S. patients. When asked about the timeline for an approval, the FDA said it cannot confirm the existence of or comment on any current or pending product applications.

>Pharmaceutical consultant Chinmoy Roy was approached by a senior executive at Ranbaxy in the summer of 2010. “He asked me if I could help his company ‘get around’ U.S. government regulations involving pharmaceutical manufacturing,” Roy told Nikkei Asia on the phone from his home in northern California. Roy was quick to refuse.

Ozempic babies' are surprising women taking weight loss drugs. Doctors think they know why.,,https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/03/21/ozempic-pregnancy-weight-loss-drugs-fertility/73032645007/,1bkgtk8,1711053594,110,565,"> Deb Oliviara, 32, started taking Ozempic the day after Thanksgiving to lose excess weight that had been affecting her mental health. She wasn’t consistent with taking her birth control pill, but that didn’t concern her much because she has a history of unidentified fertility issues that has made it difficult to get pregnant. 

JFC ||| >Decades of research have established strong connections between obesity, metabolic disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and fertility issues, so it isn't too surprising to see that weight loss medications — which can help some people drop up to 20% of their body weight — are helping many women with these conditions get pregnant, said Dr. Utsavi Shah, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology specializing in obesity medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. ||| *Reproductive and obesity medicine experts told USA TODAY that they’re also noticing the trend in their offices, which they say is likely happening for two reasons. First, weight loss is correcting hormonal imbalances caused by obesity and metabolic disorders and thus boosting fertility. Second, certain drugs may be reducing the efficacy of birth control pills, increasing the chances of pregnancy.*

Third, some women don’t take the pill every day like they should because they had existing fertility issues, so both of the above are even more likely to happen. ||| [deleted] ||| Unsurprising, since other anti-diabetic medications, particularly anti-hyperglycaemic medications, can interfere with the efficacy of birth control medications ||| Can I just correct a misconception that’s repeated in most of the comments. It’s not as simple as obesity causing infertility. Hormonal imbalances cause obesity (urge to overeat, fatigue, craving for fatty/high carb foods etc) AND infertility. Ozempic works by correcting hormonal imbalance, treating obesity AND ALSO infertility. 

Sure, some people might make a conscious decision to eat nothing but fast food for 60 days and see what happens, and become fat. Most people do not consciously become obese. Poor sleep, stress, sedentary lifestyle, medications, EDC all contribute to hormonal issues that lower metabolism. These things also contribute to infertility. 

For many of these women with PCOS, the hormonal imbalance is genetic and causes weight gain and infertility. Treating the hormonal imbalance with Ozempic (a “weight loss drug” which is actually just a synthetic version of naturally occurring hormones that vary in quantity from person to person) also resolves the infertility. 


I got surprise pregnant on Saxenda (semaglutude similar to Ozempic but targeted for weight loss and not impacting on diabetics supply) after years of infertility. I didn’t actually lose any weight as I was taking it intermittently due to cost. ||| Women who don’t consistently take birth control can get pregnant.

The articles posted lately have been nonsense. ||| I have taken meds all my life and got on the pill when I started Mounjaro. I requested birth control knowing I was getting on the medication. I was very consistent with my meds. Get up everyday at 8, water bottle is sitting next to my meds, I take meds. 4 months in and I got pregnant. I do believe the delayed stomach emptying is the reason that the pill is a terrible choice but this was back in 2022 and my doctor didn't even know that the pill was a terrible choice while taking glp-1 meds. ||| Literally obesity is a cause for infertility and miscarriages. If the infertility/recurrent losses work up is all normal then we’ll say “unexplained.” 


With the “healthy at every size” and “mentioning my weight is body shaming” movements it has made it difficult to discuss with obese women that weight loss will improve chances for pregnancy. Getting to a healthy BMI also improves pregnancy outcomes. 


I’m never surprised when my patients lose 50 lbs and *suddenly* fall pregnant. ||| And it could be a total coincidence, as the numbers of people taking these drugs has increased markedly in the past two years."

Because if so, it may be more cost effective than years of multidisciplinary therapies, tube feeds/TPN, ventilators, inpatient hospital stays… Healthcare is incredibly expensive and even a few weeks in a PICU a few times would equal this cost. ||| As a pharmacist looking at the people of this country suffering exactly because of for-profit healthcare it’s frustrating to see the number of persons stepping up to defend the system. Those prices are not justifiable and if you don’t stand up you will continue to be extracted for the profit you are. ||| This is just the start. No idea how long it will take, but more common disorders like PTSD, GAD, and MDD will be able to be ""edited out."" The future looks bright. I just hope I'm still alive to see it. ||| 40 children per year are diagnosed with this ||| When we get price controls on drugs, we won’t get new therapies like this anymore.

High prices save lives. ||| What a great opportunity to make money from selling drugs. ||| If its anything like ZolgenSMA then yes, it is a 1 time thing. Unfortunately, there will still be all sorts of therapies and other medications that have to be paid for. Just hopefully don't have to pay for a vent! Far from a cure. Also, a lot of the times you can get most of the cost of the gene therapy covered, but still have to pay your 20% copay or whatever you may have. ||| No, it's a progressive disease where the body doesn't produce the enzyme to break down fatty substances called sulfatides. The build-up of which leads to a neuron demylenation and vegetative state, then death. Looks like if you catch the disease early enough with this drug, the enzyme is present, and so the deterioration doesn't happen. 

Not exactly a cut your losses on ICU cost vrs drug cost situation. Not that I agree with the price gauging in the pharmaceutical industry, but the cost here is the life of your child. Also, there are only 40 or so kids in the US each year with this disease, so drug companies will use the very low number of cases to justify the price tag. ||| Did you just defend that price? Healthcare is intentionally way overpriced. Just because you can add bad apples does not mean they’re good. ||| As a pharmacists as well, I recognize why the prices are what they are. 

By the way let's put it in perspective that this drug will be used in literally several **dozen** people per year and likely will not be very profitable."

It's maddening as a provider because I know where they're headed health wise and we finally have a tool to stop so many of the down the road health problems. ||| So much human suffering is downstream of obesity, IMO these drugs should be made available at little or no cost to everyone with access to the health care system (for monitoring). ||| I think most of these comments are failing to realize that I am sure all of these patients HAVE tried to use basic diet and exercise. It didn’t work, most likely due to other preexisting conditions or necessary medications causing weight gain. The judgement is unnecessary, if there is a tool to help them with a current handicap in weight loss why would doctors not offer this? ||| Are they actually good for you long term? Better than the correct diet and exercise? ||| The whole health care system is broken… ||| Eat healthy, do exercise ||| Wow… as if there’s not an obesity epidemic and there are just no other ways for people to get healthy. Such tragedy. ||| It is only a matter of time before costs come down, probably little by little.  
Employer led insurance plans sometimes cover it, but a lot don’t.  You have to realize how it would drive the cost of insurance up for all the employees.   It takes a huge company to balance out the cost so they don’t have to raise rates more then they already do each year.  Right now original Medicare covers name brand Monjaro only if you have diabetes and heart related diagnoses.  Hopefully that will change when costs go down. Let’s stop diabetes before it starts! ||| Yeah I watched my 600lb life and the doctors wouldn't even attempt a gastric bypass before the person lost, on their own, a certain amount of weight. So, it can be done with determination and strict control of diet. Pre diabetes can also be reversed with diet. 

It seems to me more and more there is this push to not have people take control in their own lives. There is a push for people to feel like they are helpless and play no role in their conditions getting better or improving. Doctors want people to feel they cannot help themselves and the only or best solution is pharmaceutical. ||| I lost weight without drugs 20 years ago. ( 80 lbs) It is HARD keeping it off, but as long as I eat healthy and stay away from junk, I am good.

The FDA has to strike a balance between requiring a high level of evidence of efficacy and not withholding a possible treatment option that may work for people who are in a desperate situation. This means that some drugs that get approved will ultimately be shown to be ineffective. That is heartbreaking, but it is not an indication that the initial approval was the wrong decision with the information available at the time. ||| Let als patients try whatever drug they want right now instead of waiting for approval. ||| If I had a serious health issue, I would try carnivore. I hear some pretty fascinating healing stories in those communities. ||| This is absolutely correct and the right thing to do in my opinion. ||| While I agree, I wonder how drug companies avoid falling into the trap of Moral Hazard where FDA leniency is abused ||| Doctors have the freedom to prescribe anything “off label”. Also, “expanded access” allows anyone to try an experimental drug if it’s already being used in clinical trials. ||| Lol ||| Drug companies aren't concerned with moral hazard. They are driven by how much bad science they can get away with.
IMO. With regard to deadly diseases with no treatment, they can get away with a LOT of bad science. ||| Having to beg a doctor to get off his ass and try shit isnt going to work.

How to get into a clinical trial as a patient?,"Hi everyone,

I know this sub is more for those who work in the industry but I’m hoping maybe I could get some tips on trial applications. I’m interested in a clinical trial for a disease I have and I’m having trouble getting in touch with the research team. I fit the eligibility requirements. I submitted an interest form with basic contact info and left a short message about my age, gender, and diagnosis with the school performing the trials. I got a follow up response; probably an automatic thing- that sent the trial’s contact person info. I sent them an email last week and left them a voicemail this week and have gotten no response back. I’m curious if this is normal and I should just continue to wait for a response, or if I should try reaching out again. I’m sure the clinical staff are a busy group and I don’t want to bother them too much if that’s unnecessary. For those working in the clinical trial industry, at what point do you contact interested participants? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1cnvelm/how_to_get_into_a_clinical_trial_as_a_patient/,1cnvelm,1715255626,9,12,"Sometimes studies have pauses on recruitments for one reason or another, or actually are no longer recruiting, are getting through referrals slowly but surely, etc. you can give it a few weeks and then follow up! ||| You might also try having your primary care doctor contact the investigator for you. that referral helps ||| Do you have a regular dr that you see for this condition? If so, their office making the call may hold more weight unfortunately. ||| Honestly, we really don't do this at our site. We usually find the potential subjects from among our PI's clinic patients. If they don't get back to you, you could contact the school's IRB (institutional review board) they should be responsive even though this would be a strange request, I bet they could get you the PI's information and you could schedule a clinic visit with them to discuss the trial. ||| I’m sorry you’re having this trouble. Staff at these sites are spread extremely thin so if you don’t hear within a couple of weeks, contact them again as it could have just slipped between the cracks. 

I agree with all of the others’ comments and want to recommend that if there is a research consortium on your disease, I would try to establish care as a clinic patient at one of the consortium sites, ideally the lead site if you can, and enroll as a participant in the research consortium. That’s the best way to get on their radar. That way they already know everything they need to know about you before you are even screened for the trial, and they know you’re interested in being contacted. This makes it easy for them and you’ll also be receiving care from a team that is more specialized, well-connected and on the cutting edge of the science on your condition.

If this is one of the first or only drug/therapy trials for the disease, it may be very competitive enrollment unfortunately. Often the people who were involved with the natural history studies that would have proceeded the drug trial end up filling all of the available slots. I wish this weren’t the case but it’s the reality of clinical research at this time. 

Best of luck to you and I hope you are able to get into the study you want. ||| Thank you so much everyone for your responses!!! All of this info and advice is very helpful. Much respect to all of you in the industry. ||| My site has an “Ask[sitename]” portal where you can express this interested, and then you can be put in touch with the CRC running the trial. The first step is always getting established as a new patient with an investigator at the hospital, though, so try to see if you can do that even before you’re able to get in touch with the coordinator ||| Did you find it on clinicaltrials.gov? If so there should be a sponsor contact listed there. If it is a smaller company they will reach out to the site as well and follow up with the site on your behalf assuming it is a smaller enrollment study. If they are enrolling thousands unfortunately it may be challenging. I work for a sponsor in oncology so I can say we would be following up to make sure they connected with you but others it may be too many pts to track if it is say an asthma study. Best of luck! ||| Have you tried contacting the principal investigator directly? If the staff member you’ve reached out to hasn’t replied yet, I wouldn’t count on them getting back to you. How did you find the clinical trial? Was it through a recruitment ad or a hospital’s research website? If so, you could try searching on clinicaltrials.gov. There may be other sites in your area or region that are also conducting the trial who you may have more luck getting in touch with."

Clinical trial manager day to day tasks,"I have been a CRA for a while now and I’m planning to transition to CTM role but I will like to have an idea of their day to day activities , ranging from study start up to close out .

Day to day tasks can vary significantly from leading study meetings, creating agendas, study plans, updating the business (r&d, medical, business leadership etc) legal and contract meetings, external vendor meetings and bid discussion, generating and updating project plans, meeting with function leads, developing ICF, overseeing DM activities, reviewing and redlining site/CRO budgets and more. if you have multiple studies then multiple meetings per day for different studies.

Clinical risk assessment and follow up is big. I would recommend getting familiar with that.

You are the head of the snake and if shits not going well it’s your job to explain what’s going on. Good PMs communicate often and early. Any delays or updates need to go to the team and action items need to be followed up and not sat on.

Clinical trials to become less interesting in Belgium?,Someone told me that doing clinical trials in Belgium had recently become less interesting (probably following a recent change in regulation) and that CRO activities were gradually going to be relocated. I would like to challenge this information (because I can't find anything on the subject on the internet),https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1cibhf2/clinical_trials_to_become_less_interesting_in/,1cibhf2,1714642762,3,4,"I think this article sums up the considerations: https://pharmaboardroom.com/articles/four-key-trends-in-belgian-clinical-trials/


Tl;dr is that EU CTR equalises processes across the EU (losing previous advantages), and 
Belgium is fairly expensive. 


Personally, I'm not sure how big of a deal this really is. Is EU CTR a headache for sponsors? Yes. Will it shift the country balance within the EU from high-cost to low-cost EU? I have my doubts. That option was always there, and the old national procedures in the EU were not that prohibitive. If you wanted to go to Eastern Europe before, you could.

At the end of day it's about recruitment potential and competing trials, existing infrastructure, good experience with investigators, and similar things. 



But I'd be curious to see if in a few years, we'll see some researchers crunch the numbers of trials in each country pre- and post-CTR. Maybe we'll see some trends? ||| Big factors are that Belgium is small and you can only select few sites in the country. Each country added at global level is a cost, so trying to limit the number of countries a global study goes to is considered. 
Recruitment potential is another thing. Belgium healthcare and reimbursement is great, meaning that patients have less incentives (monetary) to participate, so that impacts recruitment for some indications. 
Belgium remains attractive because of high quality, trained staff, key opinion leaders and such, but the above factors are likely causing bigger impact on decisions ||| All true.
But none of this is new, so wouldn't cause any major changes, wouldn't it?"
Drug safety / Pharmacovigilance VS Patient Recruitment,"Do people make more money in drug safety / pharmacovigilance or patient recruitment? 


For context, I am currently working at a CRO and am pretty early on in my career (5 years in industry) I have worked in both drug safety and patient engagement and was wondering if there was a difference between the two in terms of pay. I know it’s subjective due to circumstances such as position and company but was curious to see if there was a difference. 






",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1chtjbe/drug_safety_pharmacovigilance_vs_patient/,1chtjbe,1714588441,2,3,"I think PV for sure. PV is ongoing for the life of a product. There are much higher ranking positions available, and more opportunities for growth. You will find VPs/Global Heads of PV at pharma/biotech companies (in addition to managers, ADs, Directors, etc). I’ve never seen such positions for patient recruitment, but maybe I’m wrong about that. I work in PV though, so maybe I’m biased. ||| As an ex drug safety worker, I say go with the patient recruitment. When you think about it from the company perspective, patient recruitment is worth the investment as it means faster enrolment and shorter trials. Time = money. Safety is important but largly due to the regulatory requirements. It doesn’t impact study timelines so they’re always going to put just enough money in it to keep it running. Also I’ve always felt as if safety was completely separated from everything that was happening in the study; once I moved to the other department I learned so much more than when I was stuck in my little safety world."
Are there clinical trial facilities in the USA that DONT ask for a social security number?,"I’m a Canadian and short of it is - I want to do trials in the US since they pay more. However, the two times I’ve inquired about a place they both stated that I’d need a social security card. Any places that don’t ask for this? Obviously, I don’t have one. One guy did tell me to just use a fake one….but I’m far too much of an anxious person to even attempt that. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1cha2ti/are_there_clinical_trial_facilities_in_the_usa/,1cha2ti,1714527688,9,0,"They have to issue a 1099 to participants.  That requires either a TIN or SSN.  You need to apply for one.   ||| Some places offer gift cards so I would call to ask what kind of compensation it is. When I used to work in a clinic, that would be a common question we’d get. ||| The US allows foreign nationals to obtain an individual taxpayer identification number, or ITIN. For non-nationals, it is, for all intents and purposes, a rough equivalent to a US Social Security Number. You will not be eligible for US Social Security benefits. In the US, citizens use their Social Security Numbers as de facto tax ID numbers. Since you’re a non-citizen, there is a workaround allowed by the US-Canada Income Tax Convention (treaty). This is to prevent double taxation.

Follow the process at: https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/taxpayer-identification-numbers-tin

You will need to complete and mail the Form W-7 to the US IRS. You will need to put your Canadian SIN in box 6b. 

I *believe* your reason selection would be Box A. You are from Canada, and the associated tax treaty section which you would be claiming benefits is XIV, independent personal services. You will need this so you do not get double taxed on the income. 

I am not a US tax attorney but this is generally the process. You can find more information online or by reaching out to an approved US tax attorney.

Please keep in mind that crossing the border into the states as a Canadian is a complete different process from obtaining a US tax ID number and while most Canadians do not require a visa for up to a six month stay in the US, the border agent had ultimate authority to exclude you if they suspect that you are here to perform work for which a visa is usually required, and they’re fully within their rights to do so. 

I’ve seen a few subjects kicked out by USCIS because of dodgy incomplete paperwork, poor comprehension and explanation of what they’re doing here, and we’ve had to send letters of invitation to our partners to make everyone happy. So just be vigilant. You’re not doing anything dodgy, but the border agents tend to be very twitchy people.

When you DO get your ITIN, you provide it on a form W-8BEN to the requestor (clinical trial site). An American national doing the same process would provide their SSN on form W-9. Note: We do NOT provide our actual Social Security Number card to *anyone* for review. It’s simply a signed document that we certify under penalty of perjury. ||| Haven’t heard of a TIN before, thanks I’ll look into it! ||| They still need a US tax ID number of they’re getting more than $600. Doesn’t matter if it’s cash, check, gift cards, or pixie dust. A US Tax ID number is required by law. ||| Wow tysm, this is super helpful ||| It’s tax purposes. Anything over $600 a year is tax reported to the IRS. ||| It was definitely done. I don’t remember all the details because it’s been 10 years but they did it. I want to say it was maybe $50-$100 gift cards but given out in intervals. In NYC, we had many participants that didn’t have SSN so this was a way to get around it. I will say the ICF’s got a lot of review for the payment section, it had to be revised a few times but it was done. ||| I literally wrote my company’s SOP for cross-border research subjects.

Stay at BMS as a Clinical trial associate or move to PPD for CRA role?,"I am so conflicted about a decision I need to make by tomorrow. I’ve been an FSP Clinical trials associate at Syneos but working for Bristol Myers Squibb in their office and on their studies, SOPs etc for 1yr5mos now. I really enjoy it here due to the sponsor being BMS, they have great work-life balance and I’m only on 4 studies with study team calls only once a month so I’m able to have time for my hobbies as well as learn new things at a steady pace. The only downside is my manager at Syneos doesn’t know when he can get me onto the CRA training programme to be one at BMS since there haven’t been vacancies out for a while (could be 2 years).

I recently interviewed for the assistant CRA role at PPD which paid the same as what I’m currently on however I landed the CRA level 1 role instead due to my interview going really well. Since it’s a CRO I’m worried that this will involve a high workload and poor work-life balance but Ive heard the management team is really good. I’ve told my LM at syneos and he expressed how he didn’t want me to leave and gave me a chance to re-think about it as he’s worried this new job is just pushing me into the deep end. He also said he’s sure he can get approval to match the salary that they’re offering me at PPD (since it’s quite low at PPD at anyway not so hard lol).

I’m so torn between the two, I’ve already accepted by email the new job (but haven’t completed background screening or signed contract) but I haven’t confirmed with my current LM yet. 

Please help me on this decision, I’ve not been able to sleep for days because of this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1c3qczl/stay_at_bms_as_a_clinical_trial_associate_or_move/,1c3qczl,1713090152,14,20,"I think there's arguments for both choices and it's not a clear-cut decision.


I personally would stay at BMS and wait it out, because it's very jarring to go from a comfortable FSP position back to frantic full-service. I started full service, then went FSP, told myself I'd never go back to full service but then ended up doing it anyway because of a good offer and thinking ""how bad can it be?"", then regretted that. To top that, learning to be a CRA is hard in any case, so you're making it easier on yourself if it's in an environment where you know the processes, you know some of the people, you know which role does what, etc. 


Of course, if you take the CRA role now (which is currently difficult to get, so well done!) you can progress faster in your career and also increase your earning potential once you have monitoring experience. But word of warning, we've seen many posts lately of CRA 1s not getting assignments because no sponsor wants an inexperienced CRA assigned at the moment. So they end up being underresourced, doing CTA tasks or, worst case, laid off. It might not happen to you, but be aware of the risk. ||| Syneos pays you via the contract with the client . BMS is not your employer . They can pull you or you can be removed from an FSP model for various reasons . Either client or Syneos needed you elsewhere . Also , they say they’ll see if they’ll match , but know if you accept that you usually have to commit to an additional year or two of work with them . You don’t want to pigeon hole yourself . If you want to grow as a CRA , know that may not happen right away in the model you’re working in . 

Remember there are other career paths that can open the doors to career growth . ||| If you're looking to advance in the Clinical field then go for the CRA role. Not many opportunities especially now to jump from CTA to CRA. . It might take a bit to adjust but just ask questions and put in the work you'll get there. ||| First of all well done for nailing that interview to the point that you were offered a higher role, take a moment to feel proud of that! 

Then, think about your goals: is it more important to you to advance, or to stay in your comfort zone? Change is almost always hard, but no matter what the outcome, you gain in experience and that's so valuable. 

Remember, if you are not happy after a bit of time, you can always pivot again. Without knowing all the details of course, I would say go for it! ||| I think working in office directly at a drug company and not traveling, are what a lot of CRAs wish they could do. I would not have wanted to give that up. What would be even better would to be hired directly by BMS instead of Syneos, if that is a future possibility.

I worked at PPD as a CRA. There is no general work life balance or management style. It is the luck of the draw to see which protocol you end up on and which line manager you will get (whom you will not meet until after a couple months).

I have worked for both sponsor biotech companies and for CROs. Moving from a drug company to a CRO was very abrupt in terms of onboarding and training differences. At drug and device companies, they are very careful to train you in a systematic thorough manner, and they have human coworkers to also help show you things.

But in a big CRO, they just throw a hundred random SOPs and videos at you like ""Here - read this! Watch this! Hurry up! They're due in 2 weeks! No, don't bother to read the whole SOP or protocol documents! That will take too much time! Just click the electronic acknowledgement; that's what we need for audit purposes! Why are you asking questions? You said you worked at a drug company before, so if you really did, you shouldn't ever ask any questions and no one has to tell you anything (PPD said this to me when I was brand new). What's wrong with you/ why don't you know SOP 305974 Job Aid 9574 page 36 paragraph 2?? You clicked the acknowledgment so you should have known this information!!

It just feels very insulting to move from biotech to CRO, because since you have a comparison and know better, you know that their training is inappropriate. CROs are also a little more dehumanizing in terms of how they related to their employees. I felt like part of a herd of cattle when I was there.

But to be objective, I have also known some CRAs at PPD who said they liked it there. So do what feels best for you. ||| Hi everyone, thank you for all your responses really appreciate them 🥺 unfortunately I’ve already sent my resignation email because the recruiter gave me a start date of 15th July (unless I can change that) :/ do you know if it’s possible to speak to my manager in the morning to talk more about the opportunities if I stay and discuss before confirming that my email is final? 

I’ve had more responses that support me going for the CRA role, if I end up not liking it after a year, are there other roles I can go into easily with 1yr monitoring experience? 

I’m so undecided, I suffer from anxiety and that’s why I stay in my comfort zone but I know my potential and how intelligent I can be… ||| I would go for the CRA hands down. You’ve been at your current role for more than a year so you may not be learning anything new. Comfort zones are not great especially if you’re starting out your career.

I don’t think you have an idea how difficult it is right now to land a CRA 1 role. I have people looking for months now. Please don’t pass this up. ||| Go to PPD for the CRA role. 
Syneos is currently going through a lot of lay offs. Once you get experience as a CRA with PPD you can always go back to Syneos when a CRA position opens up. ||| BMS is under layoffs? ||| I originally said to stay but now that I think of it, getting in sponsor side is pretty huge and you usually have really good work life balance when compared to a CRO. Also know that it is REALLY tough to get into a sponsor. I know, because I work for a great one. 

Working at a renowned sponsor can do A LOT for your career. Typically, it’s great to start your career at a CRO because you get incredible exposure to many situations in your field but the goal is to move over to a sponsor because it gives better work life balance, better benefits, better pay and better career progression."
Question about clinical trials funded by Pharma companies,"Hello! I am an undergrad doing a lit review project for a class. I am very new to the world of clinical research so I'm looking for some guidance from those experienced in clinical research. 

Is it acceptable to use clinical trials of a drug funded by the pharma company that manufactures it? Is this something common in clinical research? Are these articles considered less credible?

Any guidance you all can provide would be great, thanks!

Edit: Thank you all so much for the informative responses, really appreciate it!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1c3cnyq/question_about_clinical_trials_funded_by_pharma/,1c3cnyq,1713043653,19,8,"Who else would pay for the trials? I’d say the vast majority of clinical trials are sponsor funded meaning paid for by the pharmaceutical company ||| Most studies are funded by the owner of the drug. Of course, there are many controls baked into the process to make sure that bias is removed. Let’s take your average phase 3 randomized clinical study as an example. This study will involve: 
1. The FDA and other regulatory bodies have scientific committees to set the end points (the goal posts that determine if drug is effective or not)
2. There is an unaffiliated ethics committee to review the protocol before it can start
3. The protocol will often prohibit family members from enrolling 
4. The drug company does choose the doctors, but the doctors don’t work for the drug company as employees, they are almost like independent contractors 
5. Typically the doctors doing the experiment have to declare any stock holding in the company (most typically do not have these stock holdings at all)
6. The patients are randomized to the drug or the comparator or placebo. The drug is blinded during the experiment. This means that neither the doctor, the patient, or the pharmaceutical company know who got what medicine until all of the data is collected and cleaned. The pills are indistinguishable from eachother.
7. Public registries also limit bias by requiring reporting of results, even when negative

There are a lot more ways- maybe find a trial that is relevant to your project and see all the ways the researchers baked in ways to ensure bias is eliminated. ||| This sub is mostly for people employed by the industry so you'll probably get defensive responses here, but it's well known that industry sponsored publications are more likely to report positive results compared to non-industry. I'm not saying you should automatically discount all of these studies, but you should critically evaluate sources of bias and how the methodology affects the strength of the evidence. Look for similar studies to see if the results are in agreement and look for systematic reviews if available. It takes more than one trial to draw conclusions; look for the consensus based on the totality of the evidence, assigning the most weight to well-designed studies. ||| It's still acceptable to use, just take those studies with a grain of salt. There is a bias towards positive results in these kinds of studies but most address their conflicts of interest well. Look at the methodologies and see if they match what has previously been done by others or is standard for the type of treatment ||| What everyone else is saying is correct but I’ll also add this is why drugs are so expensive. Clinical trials are expensive and time consuming. ||| That’s what I figured as well, thanks for your insight ||| NIH and philanthropy ||| This was great.

Please don’t change 😭 ||| Thank you for sharing, this is very helpful and informative. Really appreciate it! ||| It's absurd to claim that bias is eliminated. Ever notice that pharma intentionally avoids doing head-to-head trials and will do the bare minimum to get FDA approval (showing it's better than placebo, playing with the statistics to, while technically not falsifying data, make the results look more impressive than they really are like using relative risk reduction and not reporting NNT)? Negative results absolutely are withheld from the public most of the time. It's a big issue and efforts to change that are relatively recent and very weakly enforced. You can say that there are mechanisms in place to reduce bias, but let's be honest here, there is still significant bias and you can easily find evidence of this with a quick search"

Have you already accepted a position or are you looking for one? ||| A CTA sounds very similar to a CUA (clinical unit assistant). There are promotion prospects, and big ones, from this starting point, but it's a hard lot of work.

I think a passion for clinical research and trials in general helps. Just knowing what is being investigated, and how it works, even if you don't understand most of it.

I feel like this job, this promotion line, this entire career path, is different from others. It doesn't pay too well, and it's very long hours. But if everything goes right, there's a new IP to market.

Has anyone here ever worked in psychedelic drug trials?,"Allow me to preface this by saying I have only just begun my career In clinical research, currently working as a Clinical Trial Assistant for an ophthalmology sponsor. I know I am only just getting started and have a long way to go. 

I am going to be shadowing my first ever monitoring visit in a couple weeks and it got me thinking as to what field I would ultimately like to be a part of some day. And that is the study of psychedelics used as medication to treat mental health disorders such as PTSD, Depression, anxiety, etc. 

I am wondering if anyone here has ever worked on a drug trial like that? If so what were your qualifications/degree? What country do you work in? And how did you even find said position? Was it something you wanted to get into and worked towards it, or did the opportunity “fall on your lap” so to speak. 

Thanks in advance for any replies I’m looking forward to any conversations or advice you’re willing to give!",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1by57l4/has_anyone_here_ever_worked_in_psychedelic_drug/,1by57l4,1712498496,12,23,"I heard of a trial using psilocybin to treat MDD at my CRO. From what I heard, the trial is fairly heavily regulated. Unfortunately unless you are a more senior CRA, it can be difficult to have any pull for which trials you are assigned to, the CRO doesn’t really consider your TA interests when giving assignments (annoying to me because I think it helps to have staff that are actually invested and interested in the TA/drugs they are working on), and the opportunity “fell in the lap” of the CRA more or less. I am in the US. But I wish you luck, you might be able to eventually switch to the sponsor creating these drugs (especially since you’re sponsor side already), or if you switch to CRO life you could always just be very vocal about what your interests are to your LM and you might be able to get lucky! ||| Look into MAPS. ||| Check out MindMedicine — they had a posting for a CTA not too long ago. ||| I work at a site that has a trial that uses psilocybin to treat symptoms in cancer survivors. We have the SIV soon and it’s our first with a drug so heavily regulated. Sponsor is super involved. Really interested to see how this goes! ||| I worked on an LSD study for anxiety as a CRC, MindMed was the sponsor. It was a really cool experience, and MindMed was a pleasure to work with. Really interesting company. ||| Former MAPS employee here. Dm me if you wanna chat! ||| I did a ketamine trial before, though the trial was only using the ketamine as a proxy. Was pretty interesting. Ketamine is no joke don't do it. ||| not a psychedelic, necessarily, but i worked on a trial using THC with the goal of combating muscle spasticity in multiple sclerosis patients.

knew nothing of that specific line of research when i got the study, but it made sense? every other study i worked on was very typical, non-psychoactive drug. the way this specific drug was formulated limited psychoactive effects pretty significantly.

for me: ~8-9 years as a CRC (i've lost count tbh), in the USA with a degree in archaeology, if u must know. this THC study was very much a one-off circumstance. (though something worth looking into, i can't remember the name of the study now). i'm back in onc now but i'm fairly certain there's a fair amount of studies going on about THC for things like neuropathy, spasticity, mood disorders, insomnia, etc. across a range of TAs. it's just a pain in the ass because, as a schedule 1 drug, we had a lot of extra hoops to jump through with dispensing and drug accountability. ||| I worked in a trial for THC. The data we generated would have been particularly insightful, seeing as how I personally did several overnighters on it, before we were given penalty rates for overnight shifts!

Alas, the company went bust. And all my lack of fucking sleep was pointless.

So thank you THC trial. I hope your investors are learning what it means to works for a living now. ||| An old friend of mine used to own a nightclub, and he told me ketamine abusers are like the “lemon Lambo” scene from The Wolf of Wall Street; they think they’re on cool cruise control when they actually look like a drunkard from a Russian novel.

Scheduling appointments for clinical trials,"Current and former CRCs -

how do you know what appointments to schedule for each visit on a clinical trial? Sophisticated protocols that have many different types of assessments (i.e., physical exam, research blood draw, safety blood draws, surgeries, etc.) may require multiple appointments for a given visit in which the timing for each of these assessments must be considered.

In my previous company, for example, we wrote out all the assessments that were required for each visit and mapped them to the units in which they would need to occur (i.e, cardiology, MD, research unit). This was done before protocol start.

How do you map the protocol requirements to actual clinic visits? Is this a cumbersome process for you as well?",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1bxmv2w/scheduling_appointments_for_clinical_trials/,1bxmv2w,1712439125,12,6,"it's always a PITA. most difficult to schedule should always be done earliest. (ie, if they're done on the same day, confirm the PI exam well before the lab draw.

really you just need to understand how your system works. who's busier/more backed up? PI? imaging? phlebotomy? ecg/cardio? presuming a visit includes all of that, make a priority list and go from there. at my last hospital, a visit that included exam + lab draw, i'd schedule a 9am exam months in advance, the 10am lab draw i could schedule the day before.

ultimately, your job as a CRC is to make things as easy as possible for the patient and PI.

and yes, it's always a struggle. ||| Yes, the scheduling is the hardest part of any study visit, IMO. At the beginning of a study, I make a checklist for each visit that includes all of the steps I have to take before, during and after the visit, and the ""before"" checklist includes a checkbox for each department/provider/assessor/room I have to schedule. For my interns I will even include instructions on how to schedule each piece because of course every department has a different scheduling process. ||| I always start with the schedule of assessments from the protocol. Then you have to (unfortunately) run circles with clinics. I definitely agree with a todo list. I make myself a spreadsheet for each patient detailing each visit based on the SOA.  We also have what we call an office visit checklist formulated during study start up that is sent to clinics prior to each visit ||| Everyone else has covered most of what I consider. I usually start with the least flexible items first, either as defined by the protocol or by my site (e.g., snagging an MRI slot weeks in advance). I try to minimize subjects' time spent walking and waiting, so I consider the site's layout and which, if any, assessments can be completed during downtime (e.g., completing questionnaires while waiting for phlebotomy). If some assessments are completed on a tablet, I build in extra time for subjects who are older or have physical limitations.

You have to ask who, when, where, and how for each assessment. I worked with another CRC to create a massive OneNote cheat sheet with SOPs, informal processes, contact info, regulatory resources, and miscellaneous, site-specific tips that are usually only passed on by word of mouth. That saves a lot of time, but sometimes you still need to just ask around to find the right person to answer your questions. ||| I work within a hospital system, so we work in conjunction with the specific clinics the patient attends to coordinate assessments with visits
The OVCL list things like what assessments are required during the visits and the timing (ex. PK timepoints, BP readings at specific intervals). It also lists what visits will need to be scheduled in the near future (scans, etc). If you are working with the patients directly, make one for yourself and literally print and take to the visit to ensure you are getting all the required assessments. ||| Unless it’s something specific like an xray, fundoscopy, echocardiogram RTC, then things like blood draw, ECG’s, obs , etc are done specifically by the research team .

Every visit has a worksheet to collect the necessary protocol and edc required data , which will correspond with the visit requirements. It also serves to ensure that the visit tasks for the sponsor  are adequately invoiced . 

Participants are tracked in an excel sheet which is designed to give the earliest and latest protocol window date for each visit. The earliest day is always the target to give the most flexibility ||| Can you elaborate more on how you make a priority list?

Also how do you know who is busier? what are your alternatives? ||| What type of steps do you normally include in your checklist?  
How do you determine which appointments you need to schedule? Once you determine this, do you check their availabilities or just send a request to a scheduling coordinator? ||| What do you mean by run circles with clinics? Is there any difficult in determining exactly what visits each patient needs? 

What is typically included in that checklist? ||| I schedule appointments based on what the protocol says will be done at each visit. That just requires knowing what procedures and tests are done where at your site. Every area has different procedures for scheduling so sometimes it’s sending a request to a scheduling coordinator, scheduling myself through an online portal, or going back and forth with a doctor to see when they’re available. It just depends."
Clinical trial manager to Clinical Scientist,How difficult is it to move from CTM to CS? Curious how often this occurs considering CTM is more operations based and not really science-y,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1bv81pd/clinical_trial_manager_to_clinical_scientist/,1bv81pd,1712187370,16,10,"You can do it. Sell your excel skills. ||| PhD here. Transitioned from academia to industry into a heavily clin operational role. Really wanted to do the science but had to get out of academia before my mental and physical health suffered. Transitioned to a CS position a couple years later and am at Director Level now. Start with your network and focus on the fact that the PhD taught you how to think scientifically and work collaboratively, and CTM gave you exposure to what it takes to execute trials successfully. Together , you’re the person who can contribute to the strategy and design with an eye for already knowing if the scientific integrity holds up to operational feasibility and can effectively communicate that to others because you speak both “languages”. Good luck!!!!!!!! ||| Have you tried BMS, Novartis for assoc clinical scientist roles? With PhD should be more than qualified there. If you’re able to work located where their offices are because they are mostly hybrid. And Merck also has CS roles that you may be qualified for with PhD! Is more operational too which could help. ||| Do you have the proper education and credentials? ||| If you’ve found yourself questioning designs or analyses, you may be a good fit.

Good luck! ||| No, i haven't. Their offices are located in a different state. Was hoping i could find a remote CS positiom. ||| What would be proper education and credentials? ||| Oh yes makes it harder.. I know that icon and parexel have FSP CS roles for Merck that are remote. Cannot remember for BMS and do not know for NVS. I think roles where you get more into the data analysis would be more beneficial than CTM. But I dont think it would be harmful.. ||| BS and minimum of two years clinical research ||| Well then, yes, PhD and over 10 years of CR experience. Per recruiters that is not enough. So considering going for CTM to see if I can then slide into the CS role."
Former Data Entry Associate Looking to Stay in Clinical Trials,"I've been on the job hunt for six months since being laid off by my former company in October 2023. My official title was Data Acquisition Associate (Data Entry) and I performed entry on ECGs, Cardiopulmonary Exercise Tests, Holter Monitor Recordings and GI Recordings sent to us from Global Clinical Test sites received via post, email, file share and company site upload tool. I also tended to take charge of the high volume retrospective studies by preparing them and performing entry and/or sharing prepared images with colleagues so they may assist with initial entry. This data was then analyzed by our Cardiac Safety team.

I would love to stay within the Clinical Trial field, but I know I am not experienced enough to step up to CRA level. Personally, I'd rather continue doing what I was doing, perhaps from the Clinical site side rather than the vendor side, but I'm not sure if that type of job exists. I'm also not sure if there are other vendors out there as my former company seems to be buying them all.

I've already revised my resume three times in an attempt to highlight what I accomplished for my former company. I try to highlight how I went from inexperienced receptionist  to associate entrusted with training new hires and providing cross training for existing team members in under two years. I've sent out well over 100 resumes. A few, I've gotten the quick rejection on, but 95% disappear into the great blue beyond. 

Does anyone in this industry have any thoughts they could share? Advice? Perhaps even job openings that I may not have found on LinkedIn or Indeed?

If they are still enrolling people, the study completion is going to be 2 years from the date the last person is enrolled. ||| Completion date may be very, very far off from results posting. The study needs to end, all data needs to be analyzed, and the final  study report needs to be done before results would theoretically be posted. In some cases, sponsors can get deferrals on posting results even after that.

That means regulatory/administrative tasks and getting recruitment off the ground.

Recruitment is hard and almost always takes longer than expected, so it is entirely possible that they never met their recruitment goal and have left the study open to recruitment while conducting follow up on enrolled patients. Without speaking to the study team directly, there is no way of knowing what the current plan/time frame is. ||| They might not have enrolled their goal of 20 subjects yet, so therefore would not close the study.

Clinical trial insurance waived for non interventional study?,"Hello, hoping to get advice on the need to obtain clinical trial insurance / liability coverage for a non interventional clinical study conducted OUS (3 sites in Africa). There is a study procedure with minimal risk (blood draw). Based on my experience, it’s always been a standard practice to obtain coverage and share certificates with study sites. With that being said, it doesn’t seem to be an actual FDA requirement. Has anyone had experience where clinical trial insurance has been waived for a similar study? If required, was it difficult to obtain coverage for study sites enrolling outside the U.S.? Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1bi1pjs/clinical_trial_insurance_waived_for_non/,1bi1pjs,1710795420,2,1,"> There is a study procedure with minimal risk (blood draw) 

It's still a risk. Also which country(ies) in Africa are you planning on working in? A starting point may be to see what their legal requirement are for conducting clinical trials in their country. ||| Insurance can be a ministry of health requirement, but you’re right, it’s not an FDA requirement. Indemnification though (basically insurance) is often required by clinical trial sites. That said, what you’re indemnifying also matters— and minimally invasive blood draws likely won’t require it on their own, but what about the data?

As to how to obtain it. You would work with a clinical trial insurance broker, after speaking with your sites to see if it’s even needed. If the study is limited to Africa, you can get a policy limited to Africa. The policy is based on risk, so the cost would be marginal. If the study is global, you can get a global policy through any number of carriers, most commonly Chubb."

""Yes, there's considerable ongoing work in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications for clinical trial management. AI technologies hold significant promise in streamlining various aspects of clinical trials, including patient recruitment, trial design, data analysis, and regulatory compliance.

Several organizations, both in academia and industry, are actively researching and implementing AI solutions in clinical trial management. Some areas of focus include:

1. **Patient Recruitment and Retention:** AI algorithms can analyze patient data from various sources to identify potential participants who meet specific trial criteria. Additionally, AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants can engage with patients to provide information and support throughout the trial, potentially improving retention rates.
2. **Trial Design Optimization:** AI can analyze historical trial data to optimize trial design, including selecting appropriate endpoints, sample sizes, and patient populations. This can lead to more efficient and cost-effective trials.
3. **Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling:** AI techniques such as machine learning and natural language processing can analyze large volumes of clinical data to identify trends, predict outcomes, and uncover insights that may inform decision-making during the trial.
4. **Regulatory Compliance and Risk Management:** AI systems can assist in ensuring regulatory compliance by automating documentation processes, flagging potential risks or protocol deviations, and streamlining reporting requirements.
5. **Drug Development:** AI-driven approaches are also being applied to drug discovery and development, including the identification of novel drug targets, drug repurposing, and the prediction of drug safety and efficacy.

To connect with professionals working in this field and stay updated on the latest developments, you may consider:

* Joining professional associations and networks related to clinical research and AI, such as the Society for Clinical Trials or the International Society for Clinical Biostatistics.
* Attending conferences, workshops, and webinars focused on AI in healthcare and clinical trials.
* Engaging with researchers and practitioners on platforms like LinkedIn, ResearchGate, or specialized forums and discussion groups.
* Exploring academic literature and industry publications for insights into current research and industry initiatives.

By actively participating in these activities and reaching out to professionals in the field, you can gain valuable knowledge and insights into the intersection of AI and clinical trial management."" ||| Check out [TrialRadar.com](https://trialradar.com). You can see a few screenshots and get beta access there. Not really for clinical trial management, but rather for AI-enabled trial discovery and expert discussion.

What’s the most common demographic of clinical trial participants?,I assume white males would be the most common. If minority populations sign up to join a clinical trial is preference given to them in order to have a more representative sample?,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1bfuxdg/whats_the_most_common_demographic_of_clinical/,1bfuxdg,1710554168,22,12,"White and middle/upper middle class, experienced travelers, either retired or with the kind of job that allows them to take a lot of time off, and no small children, pets, or other caregiving responsibilities. 

It’s frustrating that it’s this way and I bend over backwards to do what I can to make it possible for everyone who qualifies to participate. But the reality is that trials demand so much time, and often money depending on how travel expenses are handled, from participants and that means that participating isn’t feasible for a lot of people. ||| There's no preference given. If a white male qualifies and a black male qualifies, they don't compete for the spot. They're both screened and this will continue until global or national enrollment goals are reached. ||| Had a study with over 1000 participants and most of our healthy volunteer studies like this end up having an overrepresentation of white women. Men are already difficult to schedule for their medical care visits so participating in voluntary studies takes more convincing. And I have seen studies pause enrollment so we can only allow minority recruitment to ensure fair representation. ||| I work in MD, most of our participants are Black (~75-80%) but that’s the population that come in for screening the most here. As far as I know as a CRC, we don’t give any preference to race, the only importance is for lab parameters ||| For my site, it's overwhelmingly white middle class women. Almost all sponsors have diversity plans to include more people of colour and minorities across the globe, but it's hard at my site. We have a unique challenge in Canada in that our First Nations are often remote, so the visit schedules for trials are not always feasible, and many new immigrants want to get settled with their own GI and try conventionally available drugs first before thinking about a trial. ||| [deleted] ||| It will depend entirely on the local area demographics and the protocol eligibility criteria. 

On a global scale, yes white males probably make up the majority, but I have worked on studies from China which had no white or black participants and this caused issues with potential US registration. 

In the end you cannot cherry pick local demographics unless there is a scientific reason and it's part of the protocol design. ||| My current trial for women participants is stratified by race, age, and BMI. Once each group is filled, we will only focus on the groups that are not yet filled. Due to generational trauma among POC groups (from historic issues with medicine and research), the white buckets obviously fill up the quickest. However, this is written into our study design.

The only trial I know of that slowed enrollment to be more inclusive of race was the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine trial. They had been under scrutiny because of the low % of POC and so they slowed enrollment of white participants to course correct. ||| my site has two studies that are race-specific (race related gene studies with IP), but other than that we really try to get anyone who qualifies/is right on the edge of labs in for a screening ||| I think it depends on the geographical area. In some of the bigger metro areas I worked in, we had a decent amount of diversity though it wasn't as good as I would have liked. 

Some of the smaller towns I've worked in were mostly white men and women, simply because that was a majority of the population there. 

Within those studies, it was always more or less a first come first serve basis in regards to enrollment as long as the patient was eligible. Between the sponsor and CRO and the organization I was at, they wanted enrollment completed as quickly as possible. Period."

3. Depending on your role, a typical CTA is in a supportive role therefore all prioritization decisions are made by someone directly above you. My best and only go to answer when I was a CTA was “ask my PM or CTMs that there is a conflict and how to prioritize?” Also make sure the interviewer understands that NO DECISION is made without communicating with your team. 

Also use words/phrases like quality check, collaboration, teamwork, etc. whenever you can. 

If an interviewer asks you “do you like to work all by yourself or with others?”
Avoid saying “I rather do tasks by myself without supervision” instead phrase it more like “while I enjoy working by myself, I prefer to work closely with my team to ensure we are aligned on the project” 

If they ask you who you are, do NOT tell them your zodiac sign and your hobbies. No one cares. Tell them who you are professionally, summarize the resume for them and throw in why you are interested in the job and if they do ask a personal question, don’t go into detail just share minor things like “I have a dog/cat/plant”.

BACKGROUND

CEP290-associated inherited retinal degeneration causes severe early-onset vision loss due to pathogenic variants in CEP290. EDIT-101 is a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) gene-editing complex designed to treat inherited retinal degeneration caused by a specific damaging variant in intron 26 of CEP290 (IVS26 variant).

METHODS

We performed a phase 1–2, open-label, single-ascending-dose study in which persons 3 years of age or older with CEP290-associated inherited retinal degeneration caused by a homozygous or compound heterozygous IVS26 variant received a subretinal injection of EDIT-101 in the worse (study) eye. The primary outcome was safety, which included adverse events and dose-limiting toxic effects. Key secondary efficacy outcomes were the change from baseline in the best corrected visual acuity, the retinal sensitivity detected with the use of full-field stimulus testing (FST), the score on the Ora–Visual Navigation Challenge mobility test, and the vision-related quality-of-life score on the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire–25 (in adults) or the Children’s Visual Function Questionnaire (in children).


RESULTS

EDIT-101 was injected in 12 adults 17 to 63 years of age (median, 37 years) at a low dose (in 2 participants), an intermediate dose (in 5), or a high dose (in 5) and in 2 children 9 and 14 years of age at the intermediate dose. At baseline, the median best corrected visual acuity in the study eye was 2.4 log10 of the minimum angle of resolution (range, 3.9 to 0.6). No serious adverse events related to the treatment or procedure and no dose-limiting toxic effects were recorded. Six participants had a meaningful improvement from baseline in cone-mediated vision as assessed with the use of FST, of whom 5 had improvement in at least one other key secondary outcome. Nine participants (64%) had a meaningful improvement from baseline in the best corrected visual acuity, the sensitivity to red light as measured with FST, or the score on the mobility test. Six participants had a meaningful improvement from baseline in the vision-related quality-of-life score.


CONCLUSIONS

The safety profile and improvements in photoreceptor function after EDIT-101 treatment in this small phase 1–2 study support further research of in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to treat inherited retinal degenerations due to the IVS26 variant of CEP290 and other genetic causes.

Anyway, the conclusion in the headline is probably apparent to most.       
Which… I've had a Stupid Question on deck for years now, namely: what exactly was wrong with health insurance that managed healthcare was supposed to fix??

I lived through the change and I remember what a big deal it was at the time, but I *don't* remember how/why ""we all"" decided the old system sucked so badly or how HMOs would improve things. I've even gone back and researched it, and all I find is vapor. Even vapor seems generous; it's just vague unsupported assertions that HMOs would be better, somehow. I mean to this day managed healthcare *doesn't even have a definition.* (Not one that makes meaningful sense anyway. ""Managed healthcare is any healthcare that is managed."" Seriously?) 

*None* of it makes sense and I genuinely don't understand how the whole country agreed to such a massive change based on so little.

I remember adults casually complaining about paperwork in the before-time (whenever someone went to the doctor our dining table would be covered in forms for days) but that's about it. Now ***literally everything*** about health care and insurance sucks. Specifically because of the downward pressure of the HMO model.

Unbelievable. You have to check every damn thing or risk a surprise bill that could be crippling. ||| its always more expensive to add a middle man between supllier and consumer. the people that fail to understand why are braindead ||| Co-payment with no margin prices would have that effect, co-payment with inflated prices makes people not having health assistance so they can eat 3 meals a day. ||| There’s no world where for-profit healthcare insurance exists AND it’s good for consumers.

>Replacing gold standard clinical research is not the point – but researchers hope machine learning could help save time and money by putting clinical trials on a faster track

that's not unreasonable. ||| I read up to table 2 twice and still cannot identify what their training objective is or what the AUROC is measuring. It seems like they're predicting stroke in patients in the clinical trials, but their goal is to emulate the statistical outcomes of the trial rather than succeed in predicting stroke in individual patients. That being the case I have no idea what it means for them to improve ROC AUC by 7%. 

In any case: they're training on 90% the clinical trial data to predict for 5% patients in that same clinical trial. I have no idea how that could be useful at all compared to a trivial mixed effects model. For sure it is not a causal inference system or whatever they call it.

Abstract 

This study aims to investigate the relationship between risky sexual behavior (RSB) and psychopathy in a non-clinical sample of 714 Hong Kong adults, shedding light on sex differences. Our findings reveal that males exhibit significantly higher mean levels of RSB (general, penetrative, and nonpenetrative), as well as egocentric (Factor 1) and callous (Factor 3) traits of psychopathy, along with increased sexual desire compared to females. Regression analyses indicate that elevated levels of antisociality (Factor 2) and callousness (Factor 3) traits of psychopathy, along with sexual desire, emerge as significant risk factors for engaging in general, penetrative, and nonpenetrative RSB. Intriguingly, higher age and being in a long-term relationship are associated with RSB. The implications of this study suggest potential avenues for reducing, if not entirely preventing, the inclination to engage in RSB in the presence of psychopathic traits. ||| I know I'm weird but I'd suggest half of all teenagers in the western world partook in many of those activities before the 2000s.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/science) if you have any questions or concerns.* ||| From the article: Type 1 diabetes occurs when a patient’s immune system begins attacking the beta cells in their pancreas. These important cells produce insulin, and without them patients become unable to manage their blood glucose levels, resulting in a lifetime of managing injections and potential health complications.

But in a new [study](https://diabetesjournals.org/diabetes/article/73/5/806/154280/Cell-Surface-ZnT8-Antibody-Prevents-and-Reverses), scientists at Johns Hopkins Medicine have found a potential way to prevent the onset of the disease, or even reverse it in the early stages. Known as mAb43, the new drug is a monoclonal antibody, an experimental therapy that’s showing promise against a range of diseases.

Antibodies are proteins that bind to certain cells, usually foreign pathogens, to clear them from the body. Vaccines work by teaching a patient’s immune system to produce antibodies against a particular target. Monoclonal antibodies are engineered to fight a target, and delivered in bulk to a patient as a rapid response to an acute illness, such as an infection. These therapies have shown promise in recent studies against things like malaria, COVID-19, and even rheumatoid arthritis. ||| This article doesn't do a great job of talking about the cool stuff. It's talking about a mouse study and the results from it.

You want to know about the cool stuff? There is already an FDA approved drug to delay t1d onset for up to 4 years, after a single treatment, without immunosuppressants. It's called teplizumab/Tzield, and it's passed 5 different clinical trials, and has FDA approval. This is something that if you are in the very early stages of diabetes (auto antibody positive, but not yet insulin dependant) you can have prescribed and undergo the treatment. It already exists, is used in humans, and is safe and effective. I work at one of the centers where it was developed and trialed. ||| Monoclonal treatment is amazing... So many amazing drugs that make all manner of diseases that used to be a massive decrease in the quality of life instead just a minor inconvenience of a fortnightly injection. ||| It’s too bad that most doctors don’t think to test for T1 until it’s too late. ||| I wonder if something like this might help to protect transplanted beta cells from rejection. ||| It's actually something that's being done quite a lot for patients who have diabetic parents or are otherwise at risk genetically.

>•Machine learning models predict 1.09 million gut metabolite-GPCR pairs

>•Multi-omics analysis identifies Alzheimer’s-related GPCRs and gut metabolites

>•Agmatine reduces levels of C3AR and p-tau in patient iPSC-derived neurons

>•Phenethylamine reduces p-tau in Alzheimer's patient iPSC-derived neurons

Summary

>Shifts in the magnitude and nature of gut microbial metabolites have been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the host receptors that sense and respond to these metabolites are largely unknown. Here, we develop a systems biology framework that integrates machine learning and multi-omics to identify molecular relationships of gut microbial metabolites with non-olfactory G-protein-coupled receptors (termed the “GPCRome”). We evaluate 1.09 million metabolite-protein pairs connecting 408 human GPCRs and 335 gut microbial metabolites. Using genetics-derived Mendelian randomization and integrative analyses of human brain transcriptomic and proteomic profiles, we identify orphan GPCRs (i.e., GPR84) as potential drug targets in AD and that triacanthine experimentally activates GPR84. We demonstrate that phenethylamine and agmatine significantly reduce tau hyperphosphorylation (p-tau181 and p-tau205) in AD patient induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. This study demonstrates a systems biology framework to uncover the GPCR targets of human gut microbiota in AD and other complex diseases if broadly applied. ||| How do i increase gut health? ||| Yeah but Al who?

Pagliacci honked his nose and sadly left the laboratory. ||| I assumed there was a lot of overlap between these pathways. Hence why Ozempic works for overeating and addiction. ||| > Nestled in the forebrain, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is involved in processing rewards from and desire for food, sex, social interaction—and addictive substances. The NAc, in close collaboration with the pleasure and mood modulating neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin, influences decision-making by integrating motivation, reinforcement, and pleasure, essentially encouraging animals to repeatedly pursue activities that routinely feel good.
>
> “The NAc is a key node where the underlying dopaminoceptive neurons direct and refine animals’ behaviors towards their goals,” says Bowen Tan, a graduate student in Friedman’s lab. “What we hadn’t been able to understand is how repeated exposure to drugs corrupts these neurons, resulting in escalated drug-seeking behaviors and a shift away from healthy goals.”

So much research repeats unnecessary experiments on animals for no good aim. Psychopaths torture animals - often as a first indicator. Can we stop supporting this as a society - just in case we are allowing dysfunction in humans? ||| They put it as this: the difference between drugs and food/drink is that with food and drink, the reaction is pretty much the same (intensity, duration) with repeated consumption whereas with drugs, the reaction intensifies with every use. This also has the result that with drug abuse, normal intake of food and drink becomes less pleasurable. This study has delved deeper into the specifics of how this works neurally. ||| One of the key criteria of an addictive substance is whether it causes a unique neuro or biochemical impact on the brain.  Which food does not do 

Whether people realize it or not, addiction is a diagnosis, with clinical criteria.  Anything that we have identified as an addiction is classified as a “Use Disorder.”  We have no evidence that food is addictive, all we have are studies that basically say that binge eating, snacking, etc has things in common with an addiction.  We have evidence that people can have issues with food (such as binge eating disorder) but we have no such thing as “Food use disorder” or “sugar use disorder.”  

You can also mimic the impact on the brain that snacking, etc., has. For example, walking has the same impact on your brain as eating a hyperpalatable snack.   You can’t mimic the impact of say, cocaine or alcohol.  Matter of fact, the same applies for gambling.

Edit - also, another criteria for an addiction is persistent cravings.  Food cravings are not persistent.  You crave chocolate, you can either indulge in chocolate to satisfy the craving, or ignore it and it goes away in 20 minutes.  But an addict does not satisfy a craving for alcohol by drinking, nor does the craving go away by just ignoring the craving. ||| I know, so many mice struggling with cocaine addiction"

Initially designed as an adjuvant treatment for liver cancer, the precision-cut films also have the potential to treat ovarian cancer, head and neck cancer and many other cancers, where 5FU and Cis have already proven successful.

Every year, more than 800,000 people are diagnosed with this cancer throughout the world. Globally, liver cancer is the third cause of cancer death with a 75% mortality rate.

UniSA researcher Dr Souha Youssef says the novel films have the potential to revolutionise liver cancer treatments.

“Despite medical strides, liver cancer remains a highly aggressive and deadly form of cancer with recurrence rates of up to 70%,” Dr Youssef says.

“The main treatment protocol requires the surgical removal of the tumour followed by chemotherapy, which while crucial to prevent relapse, is very challenging due to its debilitating side effects. ||| Most patient with various liver cancers die of metastases, not local recurrence. Interesting idea but limited applicability. Maybe for sarcomas that’ll be helpful. ||| Damn, you sound like a downer. ||| This could help destroy residual cancer cells that aren't visible during a gross debulking. ||| As the other comment explains, the film is placed after surgically removing the tumor.

What is the impact of these toxic amyloids on the rest of the body? Does the genetic variant make people more susceptible to other issues? ||| >The risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) significantly increases in individuals carrying the APOEε4 allele. Elderly cognitively healthy individuals with APOEε4 also exist, suggesting the presence of cellular mechanisms that counteract the pathological effects of APOEε4; however, these mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that APOEε4 carriers without dementia might carry genetic variations that could protect them from developing APOEε4-mediated AD pathology.  


>We accessed whole-genome sequencing data in 3,578 individuals from over 700 non-Hispanic White and Caribbean Hispanic families multiply affected by AD.  


>Amid the well-documented association between APOEε4 and AD risk, a growing body of evidence suggests intriguing nuances in the effects of this allele, particularly in certain subsets of individuals who defy the expected trajectory of cognitive decline and remain remarkably resilient to neurodegenerative disease.  


>To determine whether fibronectin activity is related to cellular responses after amyloid toxicity, we used our established amyloid toxicity model in the adult zebrafish brain.  


>Based on our previous findings that reduced gliovascular contact upon amyloid toxicity is a protective mechanism through enhancing clearance of toxic protein aggregates and immune systems activity, our results suggest that fibronectin could negatively regulate amyloid beta clearance and therefore an LOF variant could be protective against disease pathology.  


>The strength of this study is the cross-species design with pathological and functional validation to show that ECM component fibronectin could be related to key pathological aspects of AD such as toxic protein clearance, blood–brain barrier integrity, and microglial activity.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/science) if you have any questions or concerns.* ||| It's wild that we could have been researching this before bush Jr banned it ||| So this small phase 1 trial included 10 patients and it was conducted by the Mayo Clinic. What they did was they took the patients and sucked out some of their belly fat and isolated the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from the belly fat, and then they injected the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into their spinal canal. One guy fully regained the ability to walk but 7 of the 10 patients experienced some kind of improvement in their symptoms. So 3 of the 10 experienced no improvements at all. Here's the paper [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46259-y](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46259-y)

The Mayo Clinic is now conducting a bigger phase 2 trial with 40 spinal cord injury patients [https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04520373?term=mesenchymal+mayo+clinic&cntry=US&sort=nwst&draw=3&rank=11](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04520373?term=mesenchymal+mayo+clinic&cntry=US&sort=nwst&draw=3&rank=11)

I'd just like to add this little tidbit. Would you like to know how mesenenchymal stem cells (MSCs) heal the body? They heal the body by secreting growth factors essentially. To be specific MSCs secrete exosomes. You'll also hear many scientists refer to exosomes as extracellular vesicles. So remember some scientists call them exosomes while others call them extracellular vesicles.

In fact, literally all cells in the body secrete exosomes. Cells talk to each other by secreting exosomes into the bloodstream (this is probably the predominant way cells talk to each other). And MSCs basically secrete exosomes/extracellular vesicles that tell the body to heal itself. So mesenchymal stem cells home to areas of inflammation and then start secreting exosomes and the exsomes tell the body to heal itself.

Exosomes are basically bubbles of fat about the size of a virus and they contain within them proteins, mRNA etc.

Here Scientific American did an excellent article on exosomes. This is good introduction to exosomes. Read this. [https://www.scientificamerican.com/custom-media/nature-outlook-extracellular-rna/inside-the-stem-cell-pharmaceutical-factory/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/custom-media/nature-outlook-extracellular-rna/inside-the-stem-cell-pharmaceutical-factory/)

Right now in the USA mesenchymal stem cells are going through dozens upon dozens of clinical trials. Around the world MSCs are going through hundreds of clinical trials. I think it's only a matter of time til the FDA finally approves the use of mesenchymal stem cells.

MSCs do not have to be donor matched beleive it or not. They are immune priveledged.

Check it out. In California they're currently conducting a clinical trial where they're treating babies (who were born with Spina Bifida) with placenta derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). So they isolate the MSCs from a placenta and then treat the babies with the MSCs. Now typically babies born with Spina Bifida are born paralyzed but the doctor running the trial said the first baby born (they treated the baby while it was still in the mother's womb) can wiggle it's toes. The baby can kick it's legs too (if you go watch the video in the article you'll see the baby kicking it's legs). [https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/yw3iqh/worlds\_first\_stem\_cell\_treatment\_for\_spina\_bifida/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/yw3iqh/worlds_first_stem_cell_treatment_for_spina_bifida/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) ||| Do I understand correctly that if this therapy successfully passes clinical trials, we will have a cure for paralysis, or not ? ||| This is exactly the kind of research I’ve always dreamed of being involved in. Still very early premed but it’s so nice to see that the field is making leaps and bounds. I always was under the impression that the extracellular matrix being rigid around the CNS is what made it a lot less likely to recover from trauma compared to the PNS. Thanks for sharing :) ||| This is pretty incredible. There’s clearly a lot more work to be done but it’s incredible nonetheless. ||| Wow, who knew stem cells had such potential?! ||| All Christopher reeve wanted. Glad to see the support finally help someone ||| I remember when stem cell research used to be the hot political topic of the day... ||| Reminder that the same people who removed Roe v Wade also don't want any stem cell research."

Cancer evolves resistance to any one drug, just like HIV becomes resistant to any one antiviral drug. Cancer is a huge group of diverse diseases with diverse biology. To make effective combinations for a patient you need a large pool of possible drugs, and our arsenal of drugs is woefully small. A new drug that fails to improve survival but does shrink tumors (which the authors call a ""surrogate"" measure, even though it seems pretty direct to me) is worth having, especially if it uses a novel mechanism. These trials are generally happening in patients who have failed all conventional therapy. To get any response is impressive. Yes, patients should understand the limitations of this type of approval. But I doubt it will change many treatment decisions.

Also - quality of life improvements can't be proven in most cases until the drug moves down the treatment ladder.

They will never be ""proven"" because clinical trials do not ""prove"" that treatments work. 

You will not find a published peer-reviewed clinical study that says that they ""proved"" a drug works.

That isn't just a semantic particularity or being nit-picky... understanding that distinction is fundamental to understanding what clinical studies are actually saying when you read them. ||| Yea.

Access only in the worst cases. Administration only under supervision. You are not getting off this one until the bacterium is absolutely obliterated. If a single dose of this is fed to some cattle, I am going to RIOT! ||| University ag. scientist here. Just for a little background, if a new antibiotic like this is found to be useful for humans (e.g., not just being useful against resistant bacteria, but also not highly toxic to us), it isn't going to be approved for things like livestock use.

In general, the types of antibiotics approved for livestock are either ones we already historically messed up through human use like penicillin or others that we cannot use for humans. There are some antibiotics used for cattle that many vets try to avoid because while they're fine for the cows, a shot of it can be lethal to us if you say fall while climbing over a fence and accidentally inject yourself. 

The problem is that there are some antibiotics that maybe won't kill you, but you give pretty bad side effects that we end up needing to use as a last resort. Colistin is a good example. There was a time that the side effects were considered so bad that it was considered not useful for humans and used primarily for livestock instead. Resistance for human diseases has gotten so bad though that we're starting to pull from antibiotics that were considered too dangerous for human use.

Just a quick primer since usually people's perceptions about antibiotics on the agriculture or veterinary side of things is often very different than what's actually done. If you're a farmer in the US for example, it's pretty difficult to get any antibiotic beyond penicillin or oxytetracycline. If for instance you have a herd of cattle on pasture with a pink eye outbreak (blindness and losing an eye can be common), you're really not going to be able to get antibiotic feed to treat the whole herd. That's how strict the regulations are on those kinds of antibiotics. ||| Great news! Drug resistant infections are becoming a huge problem. ||| I’ve linked to the press release in the post above.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/science) if you have any questions or concerns.* ||| This is a phase 2 trial of the GLP1 agonist lixisenatide, NEJM article [here](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2312323).

It's a promising finding, but there remains a way to go. 

The study suggests there could be a small effect of the drug in delaying the progression of Parkinson's symptoms at 12 months. The difference for the primary endpoint was 3 points on a 0 to 132 point scale, which was less than the pre-specified clinically meaningful difference of 4 points used for the sample size calculation. 

There were no significant effects on other tests, although the study wasn't designed to detect these.

There were also prominent GI side effects that led to dose reductions, which are common with this class of drugs, so blinding was unlikely to be too robust, and there might be tolerability or safety issues with longer term use given the age of the recipients (eg, there was weight loss, which is generally not desirable).

Results like this (clinically marginal effect, non-negligible risk for patients) need confirming in a longer-term, larger, phase 3 trial, and as yet there seems to be no follow-up trial fro this drug registered on clinicaltrials.gov. However, at the end of this year there is a [phase 3 trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04232969?term=exenatide&cond=parkinson&rank=5) of exenatide in Parkinsons, which showed a very similar effect (3 point 'benefit') in a [smaller phase 2 trial published 6 years ago](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(17\)31585-4/abstract). ||| Bah, it looks like this doesn't do anything for Drug Induced Parkinsonism which is the 2nd leading cause of Parkison's. ||| Crazy how this came out around the same time as the fecal transplant for Parkinson’s disease news. ||| [deleted] ||| ~~From the study~~

~~""Lixisenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist used for the treatment of diabetes, has shown neuroprotective properties in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease.""~~

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/science) if you have any questions or concerns.* ||| Haven't read the original, so I'm not sure how strong the effects are. But if it holds up this is really cool for a couple reasons. The first is that it's an example of reversing an aged phenotype in a straightforward way. This does not involve some complicated stem cell injection or irradiating bone marrow or horrible surgery that would clearly not be appropriate for humans. You could give very similar antibodies to people. More importantly, this proves a particular change is directly responsible for a particular aspect of aging. With nearly everything about aging there's a ton of academic arguments and a lack of experimental data about why we age. Almost never do we get to an actual concrete mechanism that directly explains why a specific thing goes wrong in aging animals. There's always lots of hand waving in the middle. Here, the authors saw a change in stem cell populations, hypothesized that it was responsible for decreased adaptive immune response in old age, intervened to undo the change, and showed that it worked. That's a big deal. ||| We always talk about trials that worked in mice but not in humans, but has anyone considered how insanely bleeding edge healthcare for mice is? Good thing they're not paying customers or we'd all be in the sewers looking for handouts. ||| Potentially massive for people with immune disorders. Bone marrow transplant is sort of the nuclear option for treating those disorders but it requires months of chemotherapy preparation before hand to completely destroy and existing/malfunction immune capabilities. Meaning patients has to spend that period in isolation conditions as they have no immune system. Replacing that with a injection or series of injections would change millions of lives.  ||| Thats awesome thing! ||| Oh they’re definitely paying a price for it. ||| Research on animals has been a blast for very long and with incredible successes such as ninja turtles. ||| And would benefit for longevity."

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/science) if you have any questions or concerns.* ||| Maybe it’s time for society to stop looking at these statistics and realize that we collectively gave these people literally no future at all whatsoever. ||| &#x200B;

U.S. rates of suicide by all methods rose steadily for adolescents between 1999 and 2020, a new analysis shows.

&#x200B;

During those two decades, over 47,000 Americans between the ages 10 and 19 lost their lives to suicide, the report found, and there have been sharp increases year by year.  
Girls and minority adolescents have charted especially steep increases in suicides, said a team led by Cameron Ormiston, of the U.S. National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities.  
""An overall increasing trend was observed across all demographics,"" the researchers wrote in a study published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open.

&#x200B;

The findings were based on federal death certificate data from 1999 through 2020.  
By race, sex and means of suicide, some troubling trends stood out.  
For example, while deaths from drug (or other substance) overdose rose by 2.7% per year between 1999 and 2020 among all adolescents, it rose by 4.5% per year among girls, specifically.

&#x200B;

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen ||| I really like to view these numbers in tandem with the decreased rates of socialization, friendships and community group participation volumes. The increase in drug use and alcohol abuse also lie in this world as well, the so called ""deaths of despair.""


This hollowing out of one of the core requirements of us as a social animal is really telling. We crave social stimulation and it's been thoroughly dissected that social media and these forms of online interactions are not substitutes for that in-person fuzziness that brings about more long-standing happiness and connection. That we truly need belonging and trust to be fully satisfied in our ""humanness.""


The intriguing part to me is why these increases seem to still have vastly disproportional effects on white males. What is it potentially about other demographics that while they do have increasing rates have made them less susceptible to suicide?  ||| Two very important emotions in commiting suicide are uselessness and hopelessness. If people are receiving excessive exposition to social media and believing that high successfulness is the norm, then anything below that will be perceived as uselessness. The housing crisis post 2008 also play a significant role as young people have little hope of being a homeowner, leading to hopelessness about the future. ||| I wish I had the balls to do it. This place sucks. 🤮 ||| > ""Ensuring the parents of at-risk youth are counseled on gun safety and safe storage practices may reduce youth firearm suicide,"" 

Problem is few parents know their kid is at risk. I know for a fact if my parents had a gun in the house I wouldn’t be here but they didn’t know.  ||| Working 40 hours to barely survive might have something to do with it ||| Almost like it sucks here🤔🤔🤔 ||| ""Suicides? does that mean there's more job openings?"" -Capitalism"

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/science) if you have any questions or concerns.* ||| > The model was trained to construct potential drugs using a library of more than 130,000 molecular building blocks and a set of validated chemical reactions. It generated not only the final compound but also the steps it took with those building blocks, giving the researchers a set of recipes to produce the drugs.  
….  

> SyntheMol generated around 25,000 possible antibiotics and the recipes to make them in less than nine hours.   

> The company was able to efficiently generate 58 of these compounds, six of which killed a resistant strain of A. baumannii when researchers tested them in the lab. These new compounds also showed antibacterial activity against other kinds of infectious bacteria prone to antibiotic resistance, including E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and MRSA.

A promising approach. ||| The unspoken caveat to all this is that generating drug candidates isn’t the bottleneck. We can pull them up pretty much whenever by sampling soil bacteria, which are constantly evolving new antibiotics as they compete with each other. 

The real problem is two-fold. First, where drugs fail is at the clinical trial stage. With lots of candidates we can find plenty of potential drugs that look good in-vitro and in animal models, but either the pharmacokinetics don’t work out in humans or there’s some unexpected tox/allergic reaction that bumps them out of consideration. 

Maybe even more important is that it’s simply not viable to make new antibiotics from a business perspective. It costs somewhere between $100 million and $1 billion to bring a new drug to market, but antibiotics face a bunch of hurdles to generating enough sales to both cover those costs and make a profit. First, antibiotics are cures, so patients are taking them for a relatively limited period of time (TB drugs are often longer, but still a short period compared to something patients might take for years or decades). Even worse, doctors will generally hold off on prescribing new antibiotics except in the most dire cases where other options have failed to reduce the chances of resistance developing. So after an initial burst of sales as hospitals stock a new antibiotic, sales might go close to zero. No one makes any money, so no one wants to invest in their development. ||| Could this be used for a possible treatment against herpes, as this virus is as old as humanity, for 40 years there has been no new medication and the ones that do exist do not work for a large number of people, it is estimated that in 2026 more than Half of young Americans are suffering from the virus. ||| [removed] ||| I'd be more interested in probiotic approach as these things by themselves just leave a desert behind so some form of disbalance will occur further down the line (bacteria does not recover in equal measure). ||| Awesome!
https://i.imgur.com/216uqG4.png ||| My question is courts have determined you can't copyright things made with generative ai like ai art. So if generative ai makes a scientific breakthrough does it belong to everyone. ||| Could the reverse also be true? 

Bad actors use AI to create antibiotic resistant bacteria? 

Feels like another, twisted level of jailbreaking. ||| This isn’t my area of expertise so maybe I am misinterpreting, but one benefit with this approach seems to be that it at least produces chemicals with a known synthesis process. On the other hand, pulling antibiotic candidates from nature does not. So couldn’t it have some utility in generating a huge number of candidates and filtering them based on what synthesis reactions are commercially viable? Of course a candidate still needs to make it through clinical trials, but just because the main bottleneck is still present doesn’t mean that other areas can’t be improved."

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/science) if you have any questions or concerns.* ||| “The risk of meningioma is extremely small,” Pharoah said. “If I were currently using Depo-Provera because of the advantages of a long-acting injectable contraceptive I would continue to do so. In short, current or previous users of Depo-Provera do not need to worry about their very small risk of meningioma.”

Increasing the risk from 4 out of 1000 to (at most) 20 out of 1000 chance of occurrence before the age of 80. 

Progesterone only birth control is also more likely to be used for women of higher stroke risk- a much more immediate danger than a meningioma. ||| menigioma has a .03 per 100,000 deathrate among women and a survival rate of 83%

I feel like stories like this aren't factually untrue but it always smells funny when these sort of extremely minor 'risks' of birth control get front page news right when women's reproductive rights are under attack.

Is this really actually shared because someone cares about an extremely rare disease that barely kills anyone or is it being shared to just attack reproductive rights? Would a similar story be shared about asprin or another policitcally neutral drug? such a tiny increase in such a rare disease? ||| This is also why cyproterone acetate, despite being a fantastic testosterone blocker, is often advised against for transgender women and other transfeminine people. ||| [deleted] ||| I’ve linked to the news release in the post above. In this comment, for those interested, here’s the link to the peer reviewed journal article:

I think it’s an acceptable risk to take the progesterone. ||| How can something have a .03 deathrate while simultaneously killing 17% of everyone who has it ||| Eh, advised against in terms of cumulative dose (also historically high doses like 25mg – 50mg daily in the past).

Right now, current WPATH recommendations for cypro is 5mg – 10mg, and practically 6.25mg – 12.5mg, the reason being cypro is typically in 50mg tablets, and 12.5mg is a quarter every day while 6.25mg is a quarter every two days. Based on quick research that risk starts to increase at cumulative doses of 3g or more, that means you'll reach that in 8 months on 12.5mg, and double that for 6.25mg.

Of course, ideally you transition to monotherapy and have estrogen be the sole suppressor of testosterone (assuming you won't opt for surgery) when you start to get closer to that threshold, but the cypro doses trans woman and transfem people use now is less of a concern. ||| Most meningiomas are progesterone receptor positive (I know because I had one removed last year)…doesn’t matter if synthetic or bio identical—they both bind to same receptor and activate it the same way.

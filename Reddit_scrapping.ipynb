It seems like they're predicting stroke in patients in the clinical trials, but their goal is to emulate the statistical outcomes of the trial rather than succeed in predicting stroke in individual patients. That being the case I have no idea what it means for them to improve ROC AUC by 7%. \\n\\nIn any case: they're training on 90% the clinical trial data to predict for 5% patients in that same clinical trial. I have no idea how that could be useful at all compared to a trivial mixed effects model. For sure it is not a causal inference system or whatever they call it. Great that they are not trying to argue it's some kind of clinical trial replacement since that would be ridiculous, but what else is it good for? ||| I don't like this, this can rapidly turn into \\\"garbage in, garbage out\\\" studies as other and similar studies use its data. ||| hmm, highly skeptical ||| A generation of scientists that does not understand clinical trials but rely on a machine to generate them is a experiment that we may not be doing. Solutions come from thinking about problems not about avoiding thinking. \\n\\nTo need less memorizing or calculus and let phones do that seems a good enough deal, with some limitations. To move also the reasoning to a device seems one step too much and a risk to have people that does not understand things and just generate garbage that we accept as the truth. ||| I\\u2019ve linked to the press release in the post above. In this comment, for those interested, here\\u2019s the link to the peer reviewed journal article: \\n\\nhttps://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(24)00081-3 ||| neat - however, even after we get to the point where such AI are actually accurate in every way they should, a truly scientific endeavor should still do a real, live clinical trial. ||| So AI is the way to go? What happens when they are used to replace real people? I remember thinking how cool it was when the Jetsons could see each other when they were on the phone. My point, don't think it can't happen . They are so happy when they know that we think it couldn't happen.  Moving forward is not always a good thing. ||| Set it and forget it folks!\",\n          \"It has long been known that the best \\u201ccure\\u201d for Sleep Apnea is to lose weight so for patients taking any weight loss drug, surely a reduction in sleep apnea is to be expected as a consequence of losing weight, no?  The only way this would be clinically significant is if these patients did not lose any weight but still ended up curing their sleep apnea. ||| I\\u2019m waiting for the day it gets approved to treat obesity induced depression ||| Once I lost the extra covid weight, I stopped snoring ||| Because thinner people have less apnea? Big breakthrough. \\u00a0 ||| [deleted] ||| I have sleep apnea. I don't have $1000/month for Zepbound or any other GLP-1. My CPAP will do just fine until I can lose weight with diet and exercise and get rid of the sleep apnea (hopefully). ||| Oh, wow, reduced weight helps you sleep better, shocking! /S ||| It's clinically significant because insurance companies refuse to pay for obesity medications but do pay for the same medications as treatment for other conditions ||| Anecdotally, the benefits for sleep apnea appear prior to significant weight loss for some. ||| This is anecdotal, of course, but a family member recently began taking Zepbound and their OSA improved dramatically within a few weeks\\u2014before they had lost a single pound. Their doctor suggested it could be due to reduced inflammation. They also experienced lower blood pressure and heart rate, and better oxygen saturation.\",\n          \"Journalism truly is dead. I read several different articles and they all basically have the same content. No one explaining what a junk patent actually is, why this applies to any specific drug, or what this FTC action will actually accomplish. ||| A junk patent is a patent filed, by the original patent holder, (that the patent holder knows will not be granted) in the hopes of extending the exclusivity period of the original patent and to prevent other entrants to the marketplace. \\n\\nIt is relevant for these particular drugs since they are extremely high volume drugs where their initial patents should have expired and for whom there should be readily available generic alternatives. \\n\\nBy allowing other generic entrants into the marketplace the government is hoping to force a reduction in the price of these drugs thereby making them readily available for a much larger percentage of the population.\\n\\nETA: For the purposes of the article, they are also including ancillary patents that are sometimes filed by the patent holder before the expiration of the original patent to prolong the exclusivity period of the original product. ||| I agree. I listened to a story about a \\\"cheap\\\" drug that has been showing evidence of extending people's lives, so now an official study is being proposed. They mentioned the drug, possible side effects and they did a passing statement about \\\"ask your Doctor if they will put you on it.\\\" But, not once did they mention the price for this \\\"cheap\\\" drug. ||| These outlets are publishing a press release stating facts from a government agency, you are only allowed very minor changes to official government agency PR releases before publishing. This has been a part of journalism since the dawn of the printing press. Just a boring part. Think of this as a repost with strict rules, FTC is the one putting out a release for publication with minimal background. Actual coverage and opinion pieces will come later. ||| Thank you for the explanation. I hope it works (you never know with the courts, bribes, and regulatory capture tricks). Semaglutide in particular should be more available and way less expensive. \\n\\nIs the idea that the extra patents are just kind of in limbo and still processing and preventing generics until they\\u2019re denied? ||| Prices depend on so many factors, there is rarely one stated MSRP for a drug product in the USA, and to state one incorrectly could lead to legal issues from all sides.\\n\\nWhat you're describing is an issue with drug pricing and pricing transparency, making it impossible for anyone -- even news agencies -- to clearly define one price. ||| They very often do not follow up though. I\\u2019ll see something like this, make a note of it, search for it weeks later, and there\\u2019s just even more posts of the same press release ||| I\\u2019m far from an expert but my understanding is that due to a loophole in US law, the original patent essentially remains \\u201cvalid\\u201d until there is a definitive decision made about the validity of all patent applications associated with a particular product and under US law there is an option for unlimited appeals regarding a decision by the patent office which also allows for the original patent to essentially remain \\u201cvalid\\u201d until all appeals are exhausted.\\n\\nGeneric manufacturers usually have developed their drugs and have them ready to go to market before the patent is expired but if they know that the original patent may be extended or that a new patent will be granted then they will not risk bringing their generic to market for fear of litigation from the original patent holder.\\n\\nETA: added quotes to \\u201cvalid\\u201d because in reality the original patent does expire but the application of new patents essentially has the effect of extending the expiration of the original patents. ||| Telling me an average price with a disclaimer statement like \\\"check your insurance and local outlets for more accurate price\\\" would have been find. It just felt like lazy journalism to announce a \\\"cheap\\\" drug but without any pricing context. \\\"Cheap\\\" is a relative term that means something different to most people. ||| So it\\u2019s just a loophole that allows them to troll the system.
